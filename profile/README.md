👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
